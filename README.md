# HandWrittern-Digit-Recognition  

### Project: MNIST HandWrittern Digit Recognition  

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.  

The MNIST dataset can imported from Scikit-learn library as a dataset (fetch_openml).  

Steps:  
* Load Data
* Split Data (test & train data)
* Feature Scaling
* PCA Implementation
* Building and Training model (using Logistic regression OR SVM)
* Test the model
